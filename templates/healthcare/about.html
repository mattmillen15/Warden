          <h2>Founded on the belief that every heart deserves expert care</h2>
          <p>{{COMPANY_NAME}} was established in 2012 by Dr. Robert Chen and Dr. Patricia Williams with a clear mission: to bring subspecialty cardiovascular care to the Your City community in a setting that prioritizes the patient experience above all else.</p>
          <p>After years of practicing within large hospital systems, our founders recognized that patients with heart disease often faced fragmented care, long wait times, and providers who were too rushed to answer their questions. They set out to create a cardiology practice where clinical excellence and genuine compassion go hand in hand.</p>
          <p>What began as a two-physician practice has grown into a team of eight board-certified cardiologists serving more than 15,000 patients across the greater Your City area. Despite our growth, our founding commitment to personalized, unhurried cardiac care remains unchanged. Every patient who walks through our doors is treated as a partner in their own heart health journey.</p>
