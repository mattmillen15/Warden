        <h2>Financial Planning</h2>
        <p>A comprehensive financial plan is the framework that connects your investment strategy, tax planning, insurance coverage, and estate documents into a cohesive whole. Our planning process begins with an in-depth analysis of where you are today and builds a clear roadmap toward your long-term goals.</p>

        <span class="service-tag">Retirement Strategy</span>
        <h2>Retirement Planning</h2>
        <p>Whether you are decades away from retirement or approaching it in the near term, our retirement planning services are designed to give you clarity and confidence about your financial future. We develop detailed retirement income plans that address the complex interplay between Social Security timing, pension benefits, investment withdrawals, and tax efficiency.</p>
        <p>Our planning process uses sophisticated modeling tools to stress-test your retirement plan against a wide range of scenarios, including market downturns, inflation spikes, extended longevity, and healthcare cost increases.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>401(k), IRA, and employer plan optimization</li>

      <!-- Tax Strategy -->
      <div class="service-detail fade-in" id="tax-strategy">
        <span class="service-tag">Tax Optimization</span>
        <h2>Tax Strategy</h2>
        <p>Taxes are often the single largest drag on investment returns, yet many investors fail to incorporate tax strategy into their financial planning. At {{COMPANY_NAME}}, tax optimization is not an afterthought &mdash; it is woven into every investment decision and planning recommendation we make.</p>
        <p>Our Director of Tax Strategy, Michael Rivera, CPA, works closely with your CPA and estate attorney to coordinate a holistic approach to minimizing your lifetime tax burden. From tax-loss harvesting and asset location strategies to Roth conversions and charitable giving, we identify and execute opportunities to keep more of what you earn.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tax-loss harvesting and gain deferral strategies</li>
          <li>Charitable giving strategies (donor-advised funds, QCDs, CRTs)</li>
          <li>Trust structures for tax efficiency</li>
          <li>Business owner tax planning and entity structuring</li>
          <li>Roth conversion analysis and multi-year projections</li>

      <!-- Estate Planning -->
      <div class="service-detail fade-in" id="estate-planning">
        <span class="service-tag">Legacy &amp; Transfer</span>
        <h2>Estate Planning</h2>
        <p>Estate planning is about far more than minimizing taxes &mdash; it is about ensuring that your values, wishes, and legacy are carried forward in the way you intend. Our Director of Estate Planning, Jennifer Walsh, JD, works with you and your estate attorney to develop a coordinated plan that addresses wealth transfer, asset protection, incapacity planning, and philanthropic goals.</p>
        <p>For families with significant wealth, the complexity of estate planning increases substantially. Issues such as generation-skipping transfer taxes, irrevocable trust structures, family limited partnerships, and private foundation management require specialized knowledge and careful coordination among your advisory team.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Wealth transfer and gifting strategies</li>
          <li>Trust administration and coordination</li>
