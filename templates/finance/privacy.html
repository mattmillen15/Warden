        <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes. We may share your information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We share information with custodians (e.g., Charles Schwab, Fidelity), technology vendors, and other service providers who assist us in delivering our services.
