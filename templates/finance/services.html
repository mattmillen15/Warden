        <h2>Retirement Planning</h2>
        <p>Whether you are decades away from retirement or approaching it in the near term, our retirement planning services are designed to give you clarity and confidence about your financial future. We develop comprehensive retirement income plans that address the complex interplay between Social Security timing, pension benefits, investment withdrawals, and tax efficiency.</p>
        <p>Our planning process uses sophisticated modeling tools to stress-test your retirement plan against a wide range of scenarios, including market downturns, inflation spikes, extended longevity, and healthcare cost increases. We revisit and adjust your plan regularly to ensure it remains aligned with your evolving needs and changing market conditions.</p>

      <!-- Tax Optimization -->
      <div class="service-detail fade-in" id="tax-optimization">
        <span class="service-tag">Tax Strategy</span>
        <h2>Tax Optimization</h2>
        <p>Taxes are often the single largest drag on investment returns, yet many investors fail to incorporate tax strategy into their financial planning. At {{COMPANY_NAME}}, tax optimization is not an afterthought — it is woven into every investment decision and planning recommendation we make.</p>
        <p>Our Director of Tax Strategy works closely with your CPA and estate attorney to coordinate a holistic approach to minimizing your lifetime tax burden. From tax-loss harvesting and asset location strategies to Roth conversions and charitable giving, we identify and execute opportunities to keep more of what you earn and grow.</p>

          <li>Asset location optimization across account types</li>
          <li>Roth conversion analysis and multi-year planning</li>
          <li>Charitable giving strategies (donor-advised funds, QCDs)</li>
          <li>Capital gains planning for business owners and executives</li>
          <li>Coordination with your CPA and tax professionals</li>

      <div class="service-detail fade-in" id="estate-planning">
        <span class="service-tag">Legacy &amp; Transfer</span>
        <h2>Estate Planning</h2>
        <p>Estate planning is about far more than minimizing taxes — it is about ensuring that your values, wishes, and legacy are carried forward in the way you intend. We work with you and your estate attorney to develop a coordinated plan that addresses wealth transfer, asset protection, incapacity planning, and philanthropic goals.</p>
        <p>For families with significant wealth, the complexity of estate planning increases substantially. Issues such as generation-skipping transfer taxes, irrevocable trust structures, family limited partnerships, and private foundation management require specialized knowledge and careful coordination among your advisory team. Our advisors have deep experience navigating these complexities and helping families make informed decisions about their legacy.</p>

        <p>Whether you hold significant positions in restricted stock units (RSUs), incentive stock options (ISOs), or non-qualified stock options (NQSOs), our advisors develop diversification and exercise strategies that balance tax efficiency, risk management, and liquidity needs. For business owners, we also provide guidance on retirement plan selection and design, including 401(k), cash balance, and defined benefit plans.</p>
