                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>{{COMPANY_NAME}} was founded in 2018 by a group of former enterprise systems administrators who spent years working inside large organizations and saw the same problem over and over: businesses were struggling to keep their IT infrastructure reliable, secure, and properly staffed. Internal teams were stretched thin, vendor support was slow and impersonal, and critical issues were falling through the cracks, especially outside business hours.</p>
                <p>We started with a simple idea: provide the kind of IT support that we wished had existed when we were on the other side of the ticket. That meant building a team of experienced engineers who actually answer the phone, a monitoring platform that catches problems before users notice them, and a service model built around accountability rather than billable hours.</p>
                <p>From our first client engagement, a mid-sized logistics company in the Your City-Fort Worth area that needed helpdesk coverage for a growing remote workforce, we have grown into a full-service managed IT provider serving enterprise clients across Texas and nationwide. Today, our team resolves over 3,200 support tickets per month, maintains a 99.8% uptime guarantee, and operates a 24/7 Network Operations Center that never closes. We are proud of those numbers, but what matters most to us is that our clients can focus on running their businesses instead of worrying about their IT.</p>

                <p>The principles that guide how we serve our clients every day.</p>

                    <h3>Reliability</h3>
                    <p>When we say 24/7, we mean it. Our clients depend on us to be there when things go wrong, whether that is at 2 PM on a Tuesday or 3 AM on a holiday weekend. We have built our entire operation around the promise that you will always be able to reach a qualified engineer who can help, not a voicemail box or an overseas call center reading from a script.</p>

                <div class="value-card fade-in">

                    <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
                    <p>In IT support, speed matters. A fifteen-minute response time on a critical server outage is not just a metric we track; it is a commitment we make in every service agreement. Our tiered escalation process, staffed NOC, and on-call rotation ensure that issues are acknowledged and addressed with the urgency they deserve, not queued behind less critical requests.</p>

                    <h3>Transparency</h3>
                    <p>We believe our clients should always know exactly what is happening with their IT environment. That means detailed monthly reporting, real-time dashboards, clear SLA tracking, and honest conversations about what is working and what needs improvement. We do not hide behind jargon or vague status updates. If there is a problem, you will hear about it from us first.</p>
