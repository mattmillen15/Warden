        <p><strong>FACTS: WHAT DOES COMMUNITY REGIONAL BANK DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></p>

        <p>Federal law requires us to tell you how we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Federal law also gives you the right to limit some, but not all, sharing.

        <h2>1. Why We Collect Personal Information</h2>
        <p>Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Under federal law, that means personally identifiable financial information about you. All financial companies need to share customers' personal information to run their everyday business. In the sections below, we list the reasons financial companies can share their customers' personal information, the reasons {{COMPANY_NAME}} chooses to share, and whether you can limit this sharing.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

          <li>Provide account information to us through any channel (in person, online, by phone, or by mail)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or service you have with us. This information can include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Social Security number and government-issued identification</li>
          <li>Account balances, transaction history, and payment history</li>
